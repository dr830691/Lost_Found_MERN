# Lost_Found_MERN
If you have Lost your Docs Don't Worry We will Help you
I have developed a live web-based application in which if a person lost any document, then he has to visit our portal and register the details of lost documents such as what exactly the document was, what was the document number, some description etc. 
If the document is found by some another person, then he also has to visit our project and register the detail. Then our system will match these both documents i.e., lost and found 
via “Optical Character Recognition (OCR)”. 
If these details are matched then our system will send a text message as well as an email to the both person with all the details with contact number of both persons. Hence at 
convenience of both person they can meet and take their important docs back.
